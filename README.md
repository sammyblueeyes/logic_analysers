Saleae Logic plugin to decode NeoPixel 1-wire protocol
=======================

Really basic (read poorly tested) implementation for a NeoPixel analyser plugin for the Saleae Logic software. It worked for my particular use-case but I have not ensured that the sampling timing is correct. The minimum sample rate is definitely wrong.

The project is explained here:

The plugin is for the Beta version off the Salea Logic software which can be downloaded here:
